# Project-2

Chat GPT's code is a lot smaller than mine and it uses vectors in order to complete the code.
It does uses classes and it added a funciton to remove the course from the list of courses.
The code does not take any inputs for student, professor, class, or room numbrer.
Although the code compiles it does not output it in a nice visible way.
